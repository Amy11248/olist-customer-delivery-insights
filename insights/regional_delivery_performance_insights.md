### Insights Summary – Page 3: Regional Delivery Performance Analysis

**Objective:**  
To evaluate delivery efficiency and punctuality across Brazilian states to identify regional operational strengths and challenges.

---

**🔍 Key Observations:**

- Significant variation in delivery speed across different states:
  - **SP (São Paulo)** and **MG (Minas Gerais)** exhibit faster average delivery times.
  - Northern and Northeastern states (e.g., AM, MA, PA) show longer delivery times and lower punctuality.

- On-time rate fluctuates by region:
  - Highest punctuality seen in **SP** and **RJ** (above 95%)
  - Lowest on-time rates (below 85%) seen in less central states

- Some states had unusually short or even negative delivery durations before data cleaning, indicating initial data issues that were resolved using Power Query.

---

**📊 Business Impact:**

- Delivery experience is not consistent across Brazil.
- Regional disparities may affect customer satisfaction and future purchase behavior.
- Logistical constraints (distance, infrastructure) likely contribute to slower delivery in remote regions.

---

**✅ Recommendation:**

- Improve delivery partnerships and SLAs in underperforming regions.
- Use this insight to guide **region-specific logistics investment**.
- Prioritize High Value customers in regions with low punctuality to mitigate churn risk.
